        <p class="workContent">The "do your thing" spirit of the Arona is about unabashed self expression. Tearing down barriers. So why not tear down a wall, and in the process, give every visitor a little piece of art?

Mateo, our collaborating artist, created an original piece on a custom built wall, made of bricks that could be removed. Visitors could choose their favorite and take it with them, with the Arona technical specs on the back.</p>

        <p>One thing Spain is short on: native English copywriters. And the ones that are here often don't speak much Spanish; <i>no me toques las pelotas</i> will leave them scratching their heads.

Literal translations of colorful phrases quickly communicated a simple message: I actually know what Spanish speakers are saying. Plus, they sound hilarious. 
            
I sent flyers and tweets to agencies in Spain and drummed up some business. Eaten bread, as they say here in Spain.</p>
